# Resume Tips (If you have your own insights, feel free to submit a PR and contribute)

## Basic Principles

1. **Concise and Clear**

   - Ideally, keep your resume to **one page** (especially for internships or fresh graduates, since interviewers often read your resume while you're introducing yourself — too long and they won't catch the key points).

2. **Highlight Key Information**

   - Put the most relevant and important information in the most prominent position.
   - Tailor the content emphasis according to the position you're applying for.
   - Use numbers and specific results to quantify your achievements.

3. **Professional and Standardized**

   - Ensure there are no spelling or grammatical errors.
   - Maintain a clean and tidy visual layout.

## Content Writing Suggestions

### Personal Information

- Include essential contact info: **name, phone number, email**.
- Optionally add: **personal tech blog, GitHub account**.
- Avoid irrelevant personal details like "hobbies include watching anime or playing chess" (nobody cares).

### Educational Background

- List the **school name** (if it’s a "211 university" but not widely known, consider noting that), **major**, **degree**, and **enrollment/graduation dates**.
- Highlight academic achievements (if applicable).
- Unless your **GPA is high**, it’s generally not recommended to include it.

### Work Experience

- List in **reverse chronological order**, focusing on the most recent and most relevant experience.
- Use **action verbs** to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments.
- Emphasize **outcomes and impact**, rather than just listing duties.
- Recommended format:


### Project Experience

- If the project was copied from Bilibili (a Chinese platform), **make sure to rename it**.
- If it was a team project, focus on describing **your specific role and contributions**.

### Skills Section

- Categorize your tech stack by **proficiency level**.
- Highlight **core skills relevant to the target position**.
- You may briefly state your proficiency, but be **honest** (just watching a tutorial doesn't mean you're proficient — don’t claim to be advanced unless you really are, or you'll be in trouble when questioned).
